Voicemail-chatgpt is an IVR telephony interface for communicating with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).  It is implemented in Node.js and Twilio Programmable Voice.  You will need to supply the environment variables with a `.env` file in the root folder.  Environment variables are indicated throughout the code with `process.env.[VARIABLE_NAME]`.

You will need a Twilio account so that you can provide your account SID and auth token in `.env`.  You will also need a Twilio phone number.  Details on getting a free phone number are [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account).

Instructions for deploying a Node.js app and configuring Twilio appropriately are [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/how-to-respond-to-incoming-phone-calls/node). Set your Twilio phone number's voice webhook to `[YOUR BASE URL]/twilio-webhook`.  Once the web server is running and the webhook is configured, you can use the service by calling your Twilio phone number from any phone.
